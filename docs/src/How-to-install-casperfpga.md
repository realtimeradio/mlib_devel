# How to install casperfpga

This section explains how to install `casperfpga`, a python library used to interact with CASPER hardware. The `casperfpga` library currently works fully with Python 3.8.

Once you have cloned the casperfpga repository, ensure that you are on the correct branch (usually **py38** unless you are a contributor) and always pull regularly to make sure you have the latest version of casperfpga.

## Installing casperfpga using a virtual environment

<!---[`casperfpga`](https://pypi.org/project/casperfpga/) is now available on the Python Package Index (PyPI) and can be installed via [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). However, should you need to interface with a SNAP board, your installation workflow involves the extra step of installing against `casperfpga's requirements.txt`.--->

```shell
$ python3.8 -m venv ./cfpga_venv
$ source ./cfpga_venv/bin/activate
$ git clone https://github.com/casper-astro/casperfpga
$ cd casperfpga/
$ git checkout py38 
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pip install .
```

<!--The distribution on the Python Package Index is, of course, a built-distribution; this contains an already-compiled version of the SKARAB programming utility `progska`, written in `C`. Operating Systems tested using `pip install casperfpga` include:

1. Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
2. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
3. Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
4. Debian 8.x

Unfortunately the success of your installation using `pip` depends on the host OS of the installation, and you might need to rebuild the utility using the C-compiler native to your OS. In short follow the more traditional method of installing custom Python packages.

```shell
# remove current casperfpga install files
$ cd /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
$ sudo rm -rf casper*

# clone the repository to your working directory
$ cd /path/to/working/directory 
$ git clone https://github.com/casper-astro/casperfpga.git
$ cd casperfpga
$ git checkout master
$ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
$ sudo python setup.py install-->
```


### Testing that the installation worked

To check that casperfpga has been installed correctly open an ipython session and import casperfpga. **To avoid errors, move out of your cloned casperfpga repository directory before doing this test.** `casperfpga.__version__` will output the build and githash version of your casperfpga library.

```shell
$ cd ..
$ ipython
```
```python
In [1]: import casperfpga
In [2]: casperfpga.__version__
```

If you receive any errors during this step please feel free to contact anyone on the [CASPER Mailing List](mailto:casper@lists.berkeley.edu), or check the [Mailing List Archive](http://www.mail-archive.com/casper@lists.berkeley.edu/) to see if your issue has been resolved already.

## Using casperfpga

The introductory [tutorials](https://casper-toolflow.readthedocs.io/projects/tutorials/en/latest/) for current CASPER hardware serve as a guide to the entire process of:
* Creating an FPGA design in Simulink using the CASPER and Xilinx Blocksets
* Building the design using the toolflow, and lastly
* Reconfiguring your CASPER Hardware with the generated .fpg file using `casperfpga`

`casperfpga` is written in python and mainly used to communicate with CASPER Hardware and reconfigure it's firmware. Hence the medium of communication is usually done through an ipython session, as shown below:

```python
import casperfpga
fpga = casperfpga.CasperFpga('skarab_host or roach_name')
fpga.upload_to_ram_and_program('your_file.fpg')
```

## Contributing towards casperfpga

If you would like to contribute towards this library, fork the casperfpga [repo](https://github.com/casper-astro/casperfpga), add your changes to the fork and issue a pull request to the parent repo.
