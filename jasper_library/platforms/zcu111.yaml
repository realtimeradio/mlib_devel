  # gen3 devices can internally route their input refclk or the output of the RFPLL
  # as the sample clock for adjacent tiles. See PG269. For such configurations,
  # tile 225 is the preferred tile when available. The zcu216/208 eval boards only
  # have the sample clock connected to tile 255.
  #
  # For gen1 and gen2 devices the `adc_clk_src` is the same as the tile index
