# The CASPER Toolflow [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/casper-toolflow/badge/?version=latest)](https://casper-toolflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)


Welcome to the CASPER Toolflow repository, `mlib_devel`!

## What is mlib_devel?

The `mlib_devel` repository contains a set of FPGA DSP libraries and programming tools developed and maintained by the [Collaboration for Astronomical Signal Processing and Electronics Research (CASPER)](http://casper.berkeley.edu/>). Within the collaboration, this collection of software is affectionately referred to as *The Toolflow.*

The CASPER toolflow allows you to generate signal processing designs using MATLAB's graphical programming tool `Simulink`. These designs can be turned into FPGA bitstreams and loaded onto a variety of supported hardware platforms to perform real-time digital signal processing systems. CASPER also provides a Python software library for interacting with running designs: [casperfpga ](https://github.com/casper-astro/casperfpga).

## Using mlib_devel

For more information about installing and using the CASPER Toolflow, see the project's [documentation](https://casper-toolflow.readthedocs.io).

If you want to build the documentation for a particular version of this repository you can do so by following [these instructions](docs/README.md).
This may be useful if, for example, you're trying to do old (ROACH2) versions of tutorials.

## Tutorials

CASPER maintain a set of [tutorials](https://casper-tutorials.readthedocs.io), designed to introduce new users to the toolflow.

## Updating an Existing Toolflow Installation

You can always update your installation of `mlib_devel` by pulling updated code from this repository. If you do this, chances are you'll need to update your Simulink models to match your new `mlib_devel` libraries.

A script is provided to automate this process. With your model open and active, in your MATLAB prompt, run

```matlab
update_casper_blocks(bdroot)
```

This script will resynchronize every CASPER block in your design with its latest library version. Depending on the size of your model, it may take many minutes to complete!
As always, **back up your designs before attempting such a major operation**. And, if you experience problems, please raise Github issues!
